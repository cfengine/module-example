# CFEngine Build example module

If you are interested in writing your own modules, this repo is a good starting point.
You can copy it and start editing it to your liking.

You can use this module, or your copy of it, without submitting it to the index:

```
cfbs init
cfbs add github.com/cfengine/module-example
cfbs build
```

This also enables you to work with your own personal modules, they can just be in GitHub repos.
(You don't need to ever submit them to the index).
